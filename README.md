**Course Project for MIE1624: Data Science & Analytics**

The objective of this project is to forecast vaccination rates using data science and machine learning 
algorithms in order to determine the impact of vaccination on our daily lives. Along with modelling
and projecting COVID-19 immunization rates, I examine correlations between vaccinations
and a death rates due to COVID-19 complications in Canada and the United States. The project's overarching 
goal is to derive insights from the COVID-19 vaccination dataset in order to inform how our healthcare 
system, government, and industry can tackle this growing problem through increased immunization.
